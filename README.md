# Predicting loan status for Risk management in Peer-to-peer lending market: The Lending Club case

In this study, we used a dataset found on Kaggle which was retrieved from the official website of Lending Club company. This dataset contains 396,030 observations and 27 features in the period from 2007 to 2015. 

Our objective is 
- (1) to predict the loan status based on the applicants’ profiles using Logistic Regression as a statistical model and Random Forest as a machine learning model, 
- (2) deal with the multicollinearity problem using two Information Reduction methods, Elastic Net and Autometrics, 
- (3) identify the driving factors behind loan default, or in other words, the variables which are strong indicators of charged-off loans.

The report attached is composed as follows. We introduced our study's context, objectives and literature review in the first chapter. In the next part, "Materials and Methods", we will explain briefly the dataset and its features, then give some remarks about the data preprocessing and introduce the theoretical backgrounds of all methods, empirical strategy and metrics we used in the following part, "Results and Discussion". In this part, we will highlight some key findings in three sections, Exploratory Data Analysis, Information Reduction and Prediction models. The report will then follow with a conclusion where we summarize our key findings, discuss our work’s contribution and suggest further research. The References and Annex can be found afterwards.
